I made this tool for storing sql queries that belong to schemas. Schemas belong to machines. 
You can for a query, execute this query on multiple schemas and on multiples machines.
Sql Queries results are exported to Excel.
When you save a query, it controls it's valid sql query for the machine and schemas you've selected.
Note : you can't save queries that in its own perform its search on multiple schemas.

Passwords for now are not encrypted when saving to database, they should be encrypted.
